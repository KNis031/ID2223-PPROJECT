# ID2223-PPROJECT
I'm planning to create an app that suggests relevant tags for uploads to freesound.org. Posed as a machine learning problem it is a multiclass, multi-label classification task, where a number of string-labels are suggested based on an analysis of the audio data.

This project is a part of the course ID2223 Scalable machine learning, given at KTH, fall 2023
